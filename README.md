PhyMe is an advanced dashboard built for students and teachers on plotly dash. 
1. Built to help students achieve better by preparing for exams module wise, topic wise, category of questions wise, and providing them with the exact set of topics in each module, marks associated with the topic and each question with marks, difficulty. This allows students to prepare for easy questions with more weightage module. Topics with highest number of weightage and type of questions like mcq are the best. 

2. Helps teachers compare the students performance in three divisions COMPS A, COMPS B, CSE in all 3 exams topic wise in 3 modules. For eg: In ISE , a topic like Schrondinger Wave Equation in Module 1 showed much better performance in CSE compared to CompsA and COMPS B. This allows teacher to gain insights and hold revision class for these topics. Performance of 3 divison students in 3 exams across different x topics in each of the 4 modules, allowing the teacher to micromanage and plan for specific topics.
